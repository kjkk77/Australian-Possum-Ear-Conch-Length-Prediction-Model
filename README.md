# Australian-Possum-Ear-Conch-Length-Prediction-Model

This was a group project for an undergraduate linear regression course at University of Texas at Dallas.
Our goal was to create and diagnose a multiple linear regression model that would predict the length of the ear conch
of a particular pair of possum species native to southeastern Australia.
